# LidarMapping

This project was made for the purpose of helping Archeologists and Surveyorsmade interactive Three dimensional maps of cave environments.

Utilizing a single point LiDAR device ( Garmin LiDAR Lite v3), several motors, an Arduino Uno and several other peripheral modules the device is able to collect various distances at different angles, allowing an algorithm to translate this data into a point cloud diagram.
